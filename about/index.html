<h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

<p class="page-intro">
  Understory Woodworking is a one-person shop based in Seattle, Washington and run by B.J. Miller. My goal is to design and build high quality custom furniture that will last a lifetime (or three).
</p>

<h2>What I Make</h2>
<p>
  As a furniture maker, I primarily design and build standalone wooden furniture using hardwood lumber and quality hardware. Dining tables, desks, benches, shelving and the like. I also occasionally take on built-in furniture and cabinetry work that becomes integral to the architecture of the home or space. And when time permits, I also make smaller wooden objects like boxes and kitchen implements.

  <h2>How I Work</h2>

      <em>Example of drawings I produce while designing a piece of furniture.</em>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    I typically do custom commissions where I work with you to design the piece that meets your needs. Whether you have a vision of exactly what you're looking for or just an idea of the type of piece you want, I can work with you through the design process. Once we’re both satisfied with the design, I then head to the shop to bring the piece to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the work found in the <a href="/gallery/">Gallery</a> are my own custom designs which can be built with the wood species, dimensions, and finish of your choice. These pieces generally have a quicker turnaround time since much of the design work is already done.
  </p>
  <p>
    From time to time, I may also have pre-made pieces available for sale and immediate delivery. You can find these items listed on this site or via my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/understorywoodworking/" title="Go to Instagram" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> feed.

  <h2>On Quality & Sustainability</h2>
  <p>
    In my woodworking, I aim to build objects that remain functional and beautiful for a lifetime of use. Starting with thoughtful design and quality materials, I employ traditional joinery and time-tested techniques to provide durability and timeless aesthetics. All of my work is designed with daily use and environmental conditions in mind. In each piece I design and build, I consider the ease with which it can be repaired or refinished throughout its life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work with sustainably sourced domestic lumber, minimize waste, and repurpose leftover materials whenever possible. In building high-quality and long-lasting furniture, my hope is to provide better and more sustainable alternatives to mass-produced furniture. And with thoughtful designs drawing from traditional and timeless aesthetics, I strive to avoid short-lived trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    In every thing I make, my goal is to make something that will withstand the tests of time and stay out of landfills. And I’m constantly looking for ways optimize my workflows to minimize impacts on the environment and my community.
